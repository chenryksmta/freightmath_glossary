      <tr data-latex="\frac{\text{Operating Expenses}}{\text{Total Revenue}}"><td>OR</td><td>Operating Ratio</td><td>OR</td><td>The trucking industry's default measure of profitability that shows how much a company spends to earn each dollar of revenue. It's calculated by dividing estimated operating expenses by operating revenue. Example: An OR of 92 means the company spends 92 cents for every dollar it earns, leaving 8 cents profit.</td><td>Operating expenses divided by operating revenue, indicating how many cents are spent to earn each dollar of revenue.</td><td>It enables carriers to benchmark cost efficiency by showing how much expense is incurred per dollar of revenue, highlighting opportunities for cost control and profitability improvement.</td></tr><tr data-latex="\frac{\text{Operating Expenses}}{\text{Total Revenue}}"><td>OR</td><td>Core OR</td><td>COR</td><td>A measure of one-way profitability for a load or group of loads.

FM OR accounts for the direct cost and  revenue of the load itself (Core OR), the freight that precedes it (Inbound OR), and the network conditions it enters afterward (Outbound OR).</td><td>Network profitability for a load or group of loads.</td><td>This holistic approach captures a load’s full impact on network efficiency and  margin.</td></tr><tr data-latex="\frac{\text{Operating Expenses}}{\text{Total Revenue}}"><td>OR</td><td>FreightMath OR2</td><td>FMOR2</td><td>A streamlined version of FM OR that combines Core OR and  Outbound OR (excluding Inbound OR). Used exclusively within the FreightMath Spot Check Tool, FM OR2 is used when evaluating loads when the tractor is already positioned in or near the origin market area.</td><td>Forward focused FM OR (ignores IB OR).</td><td>Isolate and compare the true profitability of outbound loads from pre-positioned equipment—by excluding inbound costs—so spot-check pricing decisions reflect only the incremental margin when tractors are already in place</td></tr><tr data-latex=""><td>Filter</td><td>Strategic Footprint</td><td>Strategic Footprint</td><td>Designated FreightMath market areas that define where freight should flow within your network. Your Strategic Footprint is user-defined through FreightMath Network Configuration App (available on your SharePoint site). Both the origin and  destination of a load are individually labeled as either IN or OUT of your Strategic Footprint.

Common exclusions include loads with incomplete revenue or mileage data. Carrier-specific exclusions may include local moves, roundtrips, dedicated or other freight types that are analyzed outside the FreightMath framework. Loads not categorized as "Analyzed" are grouped under the "Non-Analyzed" filter option.</td><td>Filter between FM Analyzed loads and  Non-Analyzed loads.</td><td>Ability to isolate freight that is operationally interdependent.</td></tr><tr data-latex=""><td>Filter</td><td>Bill To Type</td><td>BT Type</td><td>The classification of a Bill To entity as either a Shipper (typically contract freight) or a Broker (typically spot freight). KSMTA uses AI to automatically categorize Bill Tos, but users can make manual adjustments through KSMTA’s Network Configuration App (available on your SharePoint site).</td><td>Whether a Bill To is a shipper or broker.</td><td>Reveals a carrier’s reliance on brokers and  highlights profitability variances between shipper and  broker freight.</td></tr><tr data-latex=""><td>Timeframe</td><td>Period (4wk)</td><td>Period (4wk)</td><td>Displays performance in distinct, non-overlapping four-week time blocks.
